A while back, a friend at NASA asked me to build a twitter bot that would tweet the current weather from the Mars InSight Rover. So I did. Due to things outside of my control, however, it was never used. Oh well. It was hosted on glitch and worked a charm. Caution - if you do host this on glitch and are making changes, be aware that if you leave a tab or window with your endpoint open, every keystroke you make will cause the bot to tweet ... obviously... however, this is a fact I forgot one day, and thus, one of my twitter accounts got banned after a few thousand weather tweets in about an hours time. Oh well! Life goes on. 

A super-duper simple twitter bot that creates a screenshot from the image and data overlay found at https://mars.nasa.gov/layout/embed/image/insightweather/ for tweeting daily weather updates from InSight. Built with Node and PhantomJS.
